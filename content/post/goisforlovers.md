When you join our tour full day tour in Mekong Delta, you will get to experience the bustling commerce of its towns contrasts sharply with the languid, almost-soporific pace of life in the countryside. Coconut and fruit-laden boats float slowly along the mud-brown waters, and two-wheeled exploration of the narrow lanes is amply rewarded with a true taste of rural hospitality (and delicious river fish). You will relax and enjoy completely exploring Mekong delta in an authentic way. You will stay local, eat local and talk with locals
